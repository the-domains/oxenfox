GROVEMADE WOODEN SPEAKER SYSTEM
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/956606f0-b2d9-4c82-86d4-380fbe0ceced.jpg)

Created in collaboration with industrial designer Joey Roth, the [Grovemade Wooden Speaker System][0] uses its natural material to full effect. Each set's enclosures are crafted one at a time in Portland using CNC machining and hand forming, leaving the interior without any parallel walls or flat surfaces, eliminating distortion. The 2-inch full-range drivers benefit further from the back-loaded horn, as well as the 2x25W amplifier. Each shell is finished with two coats of natural oil and set atop a leather stainless steel stand. Available in maple or walnut.
